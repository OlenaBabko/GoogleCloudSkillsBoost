Using Specialized Processors with Document AI (Python)


GSP1140


Task 1. Enable the Document AI API
Before you can begin using Document AI, you must enable the API.
Open Cloud Shell by clicking the Activate Cloud Shell button at the top of the console.
In Cloud Shell, run the following commands to enable the API for Document AI.
gcloud services enable documentai.googleapis.com
Copied!
You should see something like this:
Operation "operations/..." finished successfully.
You will also need to install Pandas, an Open Source Data Analysis library for Python.
Run the following command to install Pandas.
pip3 install --upgrade pandas
Copied!
Run the following command to install the Python client libraries for Document AI.
pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-documentai
Copied!
You should see something like this:
...
Installing collected packages: google-cloud-documentai
Successfully installed google-cloud-documentai-2.15.0
Now, you're ready to use the Document AI API!
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Enable the Document AI API




Task 2. Create a Form Parser processor
You must first create a Form Parser processor instance to use in the Document AI Platform for this tutorial.
From the Navigation Menu, click VIEW ALL PRODUCTS under Artificial Intelligence, select Document AI.
Click Explore Processors, scroll down to Specialized and and inside Invoice Parser, click Create Processor.
Give it the name lab-invoice-parser and select the closest region on the list.
Click Create to create your processor.
Copy your Processor ID. You must use this in your code later


Create a processor


Download sample documents
We have a few sample documents which you can use for this lab.
Run the following command to download the sample forms to Cloud Shell.
gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-samples-data/documentai/codelabs/specialized-processors/procurement_multi_document.pdf .

gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-samples-data/documentai/codelabs/specialized-processors/google_invoice.pdf .
Copied!
Confirm the files are downloaded to Cloud Shell using the below command:
ls
Copied!
You should see something like this:
google_invoice.pdf  procurement_multi_document.pdf






Task 3. Extract the entities
Now you can extract the schematized entities from the files, including confidence scores, properties, and normalized values.
The code for making the API request is identical to the previous step, and it can be done with online or batch requests.
You will access the following information from the entities:
Entity Type
(e.g. invoice_date, receiver_name, total_amount)
Raw Values
Data values as presented in the original document file.
Normalized Values
Data values in a normalized and standard format, if applicable.
Also can include enrichment from Enterprise Knowledge Graph
Confidence Values
How "sure" the model is that the values are accurate.
Some entity types, such as line_item can also include properties which are nested entities such as line_item/unit_price and line_item/description. This example flattens out the nested structure for ease of viewing.
Invoice Parser
In Cloud Shell, create a file called extraction.py and paste the following code into it:



import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import documentai_v1 as documentai


def online_process(
    project_id: str,
    location: str,
    processor_id: str,
    file_path: str,
    mime_type: str,
) -> documentai.Document:
    """
    Processes a document using the Document AI Online Processing API.
    """

    opts = {"api_endpoint": f"{location}-documentai.googleapis.com"}

    # Instantiates a client
    documentai_client = documentai.DocumentProcessorServiceClient(client_options=opts)

    # The full resource name of the processor, e.g.:
    # projects/project-id/locations/location/processor/processor-id
    # You must create new processors in the Cloud Console first
    resource_name = documentai_client.processor_path(project_id, location, processor_id)

    # Read the file into memory
    with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
        file_content = file.read()

    # Load Binary Data into Document AI RawDocument Object
    raw_document = documentai.RawDocument(content=file_content, mime_type=mime_type)

    # Configure the process request
    request = documentai.ProcessRequest(name=resource_name, raw_document=raw_document)

    # Use the Document AI client to process the sample form
    result = documentai_client.process_document(request=request)

    return result.document


PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
LOCATION = "YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION"  # Format is 'us' or 'eu'
PROCESSOR_ID = "INVOICE_PARSER_ID"  # Create processor in Cloud Console

# The local file in your current working directory

# Refer to https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list
# for supported file types
MIME_TYPE = "application/pdf"

document = online_process(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    processor_id=PROCESSOR_ID,
    file_path=FILE_PATH,
    mime_type=MIME_TYPE,
)

types = []
raw_values = []
normalized_values = []
confidence = []

# Grab each key/value pair and their corresponding confidence scores.
for entity in document.entities:
    types.append(entity.type_)
    raw_values.append(entity.mention_text)
    normalized_values.append(entity.normalized_value.text)
    confidence.append(f"{entity.confidence:.0%}")

    # Get Properties (Sub-Entities) with confidence scores
    for prop in entity.properties:
        types.append(prop.type_)
        raw_values.append(prop.mention_text)
        normalized_values.append(prop.normalized_value.text)
        confidence.append(f"{prop.confidence:.0%}")

# Create a Pandas Dataframe to print the values in tabular format.
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Type": types,
        "Raw Value": raw_values,
        "Normalized Value": normalized_values,
        "Confidence": confidence,
    }
)

print(df)



Copied!
Replace INVOICE_PARSER_ID with the ID for the Invoice Parser Processor you created earlier and use the file google_invoice.pdf.
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION with your Google Cloud Project ID and Processor location, respectively.
Run the script:
python3 extraction.py
Copied!


Your output should look something like this:

Optional: Try out other specialized processors
You've successfully used Document AI for Procurement to classify documents and parse an invoice. Document AI also supports the other specialized solutions listed here:
Identity
Lending
Contracts
You can follow the same procedure and use the same code to handle any specialized processor.
If you would like to try out the other specialized solutions, you can re-run the lab with other processor types and specialized sample documents.
Note: Some Identity, Lending, and Contract processors are currently in limited access. If you have a business use case for these processors, please fill out and submit the appropriate request form before proceeding.
Sample Documents
Here are some sample documents you can use to try out the other specialized processors.

You can find other sample documents and processor output in the documentation.




Congratulations!
Congratulations! You've successfully used Document AI to parse an invoice. You also learned how to use the Python Client Library to call the Document AI API.
