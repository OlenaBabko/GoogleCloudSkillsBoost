Overview
The Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API enables easy integration of Google speech recognition technologies into developer applications. The Speech-to-Text API allows you to send audio and receive a text transcription from the service.



###
Task 1. Create an API key
To create an API key, click Navigation menu > APIs & services > Credentials.
Then click Create credentials.
In the drop down menu, select API key.
Copy the key you just generated and click Close.

Create an API Key
In the Navigation menu, select Compute Engine. You should see a linux-instance listed in the VM instances window.
Click on the SSH button in line with the linux-instance. You will be brought to an interactive shell.
In the command line, enter in the following, replacing <YOUR_API_KEY> with the API key you copied from previously generated:
export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>



###
Task 2. Create your Speech-to-Text API request
Note: You will use a pre-recorded file that's available on Cloud Storage: gs://cloud-samples-tests/speech/brooklyn.flac. Listen to the audio file before sending it to the Speech-to-Text API.
Create request.json in the SSH command line. You'll use this to build your request to the Speech-to-Text API:
touch request.json

Open the request.json:
nano request.json

Note: You can use your preferred command line editor (nano, vim, emacs) or gcloud. This lab will provide instructions for nano.
Add the following to your request.json file, using the uri value of the sample raw audio file:

{
  "config": {
      "encoding":"FLAC",
      "languageCode": "en-US"
  },
  "audio": {
      "uri":"gs://cloud-samples-tests/speech/brooklyn.flac"
  }
}


Press control + x and then y to save and click Enter to close the request.json file.
The request body has a config and audio object.



###
Task 3. Call the Speech-to-Text API
Pass your request body, along with the API key environment variable, to the Speech-to-Text API with the following curl command (all in one single command line):

curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json \
"https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=${API_KEY}"


Your response should look something like this:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "transcript": "how old is the Brooklyn Bridge",
          "confidence": 0.98267895
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
The transcript value will return the Speech-to-Text API's text transcription of your audio file, and the confidence value indicates how sure the API is that it has accurately transcribed your audio.


Run the following command to save the response in a result.json file:

curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json \
"https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=${API_KEY}" > result.json


Congratulations!
You used the Speech-to-Text API to retrieve a transcript of an input audio file.
