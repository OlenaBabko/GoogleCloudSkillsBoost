Overview
The Cloud Translation API uses Google’s neural machine translation technology to instantly translate texts into more than one hundred languages.

###
Click Activate Cloud Shell Activate Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Google Cloud console.
(Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list
Click Authorize.
(Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
gcloud config list project
Set the region for your project
export REGION=us-west1
gcloud config set compute/region $REGION



###
Task 1. Create an API key
in the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click APIs & services > Credentials.
Click +CREATE CREDENTIALS.
In the drop down menu, select API key.
Copy the key you just generated.
Next, save it to an environment variable to avoid having to insert the value of your API key in each request.
Run the following in Cloud Shell. Be sure to replace <your_api_key> with the key you just copied:
export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>



###
Task 2. Translate text
In this example you translate the string "My name is Steve" into Spanish.
Pass the text to be translated, along with the API key environment variable, to the Translation API with the following curl command:

TEXT="My%20name%20is%20Steve"
curl "https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?target=es&key=${API_KEY}&q=${TEXT}"


Your response should look like this:

{
  "data": {
    "translations": [
      {
        "translatedText": "Mi nombre es Steve",
        "detectedSourceLanguage": "en"
      }
    ]
  }
}

In the response, you can see that the translated text and the source language that the API detected.​




###
Task 3. Detect the language
In this example you detect the language of two strings.
Pass the text to be examined, along with the API key environment variable, to the Translation API with the following curl command:
TEXT_ONE="Meu%20nome%20é%20Steven"
TEXT_TWO="日本のグーグルのオフィスは、東京の六本木ヒルズにあります"
curl "https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2/detect?key=${API_KEY}&q=${TEXT_ONE}&q=${TEXT_TWO}"

Your response should look like this:

{
  "data": {
    "detections": [
      [
        {
          "isReliable": false,
          "language": "pt",
          "confidence": 1
        }
      ],
      [
        {
          "language": "ja",
          "isReliable": false,
          "confidence": 1
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
The languages returned by this sample are "pt" and "ja". 
These are the ISO-639-1 identifiers for Portuguese and Japanese. 
This list of languages supported by the Translation API lists all the possible language codes which can be returned.


Congratulations!
