The Speech-to-Text API lets you transcribe audio speech files to text files in over 80 languages.


###
Task 1. Create an API key
in the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click APIs & services > Credentials.
Click +CREATE CREDENTIALS.
In the drop down menu, select API key.
Copy the key you just generated.
Next, save it to an environment variable to avoid having to insert the value of your API key in each request.

To perform the next steps, connect to the linux-instance provisioned for you via SSH:
On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon) click Compute Engine > VM Instances.
Click SSH to the right of the linux-instance VM name.
An interactive shell opens. Use this to perform the next operations.
In the shell (SSH) run the following, replacing <your_api_key> with the key you just copied:
export API_KEY=AIzaSyAK-VVtItwwjVgT8m8a7TilZTWb0XnCfJE


###
Task 2. Create your API request
Note: This lab uses a pre-recorded file that's available on Cloud Storage: gs://cloud-samples-data/speech/brooklyn_bridge.flac. Before sending it to the Speech-to-Text API, you can listen to this file.
Build your request to the API in a request.json file. Create the request.json file:
touch request.json

Open the file using your preferred command line editor (nano, vim, emacs) or gcloud 
nano request.json

and then add the following to your request.json file, using the uri value of the sample raw audio file:

{
  "config": {
      "encoding":"FLAC",
      "languageCode": "en-US"
  },
  "audio": {
      "uri":"gs://cloud-samples-data/speech/brooklyn_bridge.flac"
  }
}


Save the file as needed.
CTRL+X, Y, ENTER

The request body has a config and audio object.
The encoding parameter tells the API which type of audio encoding you're using while the file is being sent to the API. 
In the audio object, you pass the API the uri of the audio file, which is stored in Cloud Storage for this lab.



###
Task 3. Call the Speech-to-Text API
Pass your request body, along with the API key environment variable, to the API with the following curl command (all in one single command line):

curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json \
"https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=${API_KEY}" > result.json


Your response is stored in a file named as result.json.
To see the contents of file you can use:
cat result.json


The response returned by the curl command look something like this:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "transcript": "how old is the Brooklyn Bridge",
          "confidence": 0.98216057
        }
      ],
      "resultEndTime": "1.770s",
      "languageCode": "en-us"
    }
  ],
  "totalBilledTime": "15s"
}

The transcript value returns the Speech API's text transcription of your audio file, and the confidence value indicates how sure the API is that it has accurately transcribed your audio.



###
Task 4. Speech-to-Text transcription in different languages
You can change the language_code parameter in request.json. 
Try a French audio file - (for a preview, listen here).

Edit your request.json 
nano request.json 

and change the content to the following:
 {
  "config": {
      "encoding":"FLAC",
      "languageCode": "fr"
  },
  "audio": {
      "uri":"gs://cloud-samples-data/speech/corbeau_renard.flac"
  }
}

CTRL+X, Y, ENTER

Call the Speech-to-Text by running the curl command again.
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json \
"https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=${API_KEY}" > result.json


See the results:
cat result.json


You should see the following response:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "transcript": "maître corbeau sur un arbre perché Tenait dans son bec un fromage maître Renard par l'odeur alléché lui tint à peu près ce langage et bonjour monsieur du corbeau",
          "confidence": 0.93855613
        }
      ],
      "resultEndTime": "12.630s",
      "languageCode": "fr-fr"
    }
  ],
  "totalBilledTime": "15s"
}

This is a sentence from a popular French children’s tale by Jean de la Fontaine. 


Congratulations!
You've performed speech to text transcription with the Speech API. You passed the API the Cloud Storage URI of your audio file and reviewed the alternative of passing a base64 encoded string of your audio content.
