# Task 1. Create a dataset
# click on the View actions icon next to your project ID and select Create dataset.
# name your Dataset ID bqml_lab and click Create dataset.

# Task 2. Create a model
# Go to BigQuery EDITOR, type or paste the following query to create a model that predicts whether a visitor will make a transaction:
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`

# Click RUN.



## (Optional) Model information & training statistics
# get information about the model by expanding bqml_lab dataset and then clicking the sample_model model in the UI.
# Under the Details tab you should find some basic model info and training options used to produce the model.
# Under Training, you should see a table either a table or graphs


# Task 3. Evaluate the model
# Replace the previous query with the following and then click Run:
#standardSQL
