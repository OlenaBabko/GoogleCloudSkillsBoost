GSP341_Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab
form-3


### Task 1
# Create a new dataset
# One of the projects you are working on needs to provide analysis based on real-world data.
# Your role in this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models.
# So, in this task, you have to create a dataset with the dataset ID 'bq_dataset' in which you can store your machine learning models.

***
#In the Google Cloud Console, select Navigation menu > BigQuery.
# message box provides a link to the quickstart guide and the release notes.
# Click Done
# click on the View actions icon next to your project ID and select Create dataset.
# name your Dataset ID bq_dataset and click Create dataset.




### Task 2
# Create and evaluate a model
# There is a newly available ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. 
# In this task you will use this data to create a model that predicts whether a visitor will make a transaction.
# Here you have to used the visitor's devices operating system, whether said device is a mobile device, 
# the visitor's country and the number of page views as the criteria for whether a transaction has been made. 
# Also you have to specify the model type as binary logistic regression
# Create a model named 'predicts_visitor_model' in the precreated dataset 'bqml_dataset' that predicts whether a visitor will make a transaction.
# Also, evaluate the model 'predicts_visitor_model'.
# Use the model type as linear regression model
# Note: In case you're unable to view pre-created resources in bigquery as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are still being provisioned, # please refresh the page and try again in a few minutes." If you do, just wait a short time and reload your page.

## Task 3
# Use the model to predict purchases per country
# For this task you have precreated dataset 'bqml_dataset' which contains a model 'predict_purchase_model'. 
# You have to find out the top 10 countries with the highest transactions.
# Use the precreated model 'predict_purchase_model' in the dataset 'bqml_dataset' to predict purchases per country.
# Run the query to predict the number of transactions made by visitors of each country, sort the results, and select the top 10 countries by purchases.
# Note: In case you're unable to view pre-created resources in bigquery as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are
