Overview
Natural language is the language that humans use to communicate with each other. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that is concerned with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP research has the goal of enabling computers to understand and process human language in a way that is similar humans.

Click Activate Cloud Shell Activate Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Google Cloud console.
When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your Project_ID, PROJECT_ID. The output contains a line that declares the Project_ID for this session:
You can list the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list
You can list the project ID with this command:
gcloud config list project


###
Task 1. Create an API key
set an environment variable with your PROJECT_ID which you will use throughout this lab:
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)

create a new service account to access the Natural Language API:
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-natlang-sa \
  --display-name "my natural language service account"

create credentials to log in as your new service account. Create these credentials and save it as a JSON file "~/key.json" by using the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \
  --iam-account my-natlang-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

Finally, set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable. :
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/USER/key.json"


###
Task 2. Make an entity analysis request
Open the navigation menu and select Compute Engine.
Click on the SSH button. Remain in this SSH session for the rest of the lab.
Now you'll try out the Natural Language API's entity analysis with the following sentence:

Michelangelo Caravaggio, Italian painter, is known for 'The Calling of Saint Matthew'

Run the following gcloud command:
gcloud ml language analyze-entities --content="Michelangelo Caravaggio, Italian painter, is known for 'The Calling of Saint Matthew'." > result.json

Make an Entity Analysis Request
Run the below command to preview the output of result.json file:
cat result.json

You should see a response similar to the following in the result.json file:

}
Read through your results. For each "entity" in the response, you'll see:

The entity name and type, a person, location, event, etc.
metadata, an associated Wikipedia URL if there is one.
salience, and the indices of where this entity appeared in the text. Salience is a number in the [0,1] range that refers to the centrality of the entity to the text as a whole.
mentions, which is the same entity mentioned in different ways.
You've sent your first request to the Cloud Natural Language API.

Congratulations!
You extracted entities from a snippet of text using the Cloud Natural Language API.
